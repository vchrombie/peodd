**Note:** Right now, this tool supports only some poetry formats of the dependencies (specifically 
`foo = '^n.n.n'`, `foo = '>=n.n.n'`, `foo = 'n.n.n'`). I would be interested to add support 
for more formats, please [open an issue](https://github.com/vchrombie/peodd/issues/new) incase 
if you need any other. 

## Requirements

 * Poetry >= 1.0

### Prerequisites

#### Poetry

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for managing the project.
You can install it following [these steps](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

We use [Bitergia/release-tools](https://github.com/Bitergia/release-tools) for managing

Once you install the tool, you can use it with the `peodd` command.
