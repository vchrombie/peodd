## peodd 0.4.0 - (2022-01-06)

**New features:**

 * Add support for poetry extras (#3)\
   This feature adds support for exporting poetry extras. The extras
   dependency will have a dictionary with the version number. The name
   and version is extracted and is written to the file.

**Feature changes:**

 * Change the way how peodd handles unsupported dependency format\
   Earlier, peodd used to skip any dependency if it is not supported.
   This is changed and now it raises an exception saying the format is
   not supported and stops the program.
