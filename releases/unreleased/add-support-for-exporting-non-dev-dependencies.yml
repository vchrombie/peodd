title: Add support for exporting non-dev dependencies
category: added
author: Lewi Uberg <lewi@uberg.me>
issue: null
notes: >
  Add possibility to export only non-dev dependencies to a txt file
  with the `--non-dev` flag, and remove the default filename, forcing
  the user to provide one with the `-o`, `--output` flag.
  Usage: ``` $ peodd --non-dev -o requirements.txt ```
